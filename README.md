# cljs-rest: A ClojureScript REST client

`[cljs-rest "1.0.0"]`

A ClojureScript REST client, suitable for AJAX interaction with RESTful APIs.

### Basic usage

```clojure
(ns my-ns
  (:require-macros [cljs.core.async.macros :refer [go]])
  (:require [cljs.core.async :refer [<!]]
            [cljs-rest :as rest]))

(def entries
  (rest/resource-listing "https://api.whatever.org/entries/"))

(def entry-1
  (rest/resource "https://api.whatever.org/entries/1/"))

(go
  (<! (rest/options entries))
  ;; #cljs-rest.core.ResourceOptions{:success true :data {...}}

  (<! (rest/read entries))
  ;; #cljs-rest.core.ResourceListing{:success true :resources [] ,,,}

  (<! (rest/read entry-1))
  ;; #cljs-rest.core.Resource{:success false :status 404 ,,,}

  (<! (rest/create entries {:title "Foo" :body "Lorem"}))
  ;; #cljs-rest.core.Resource{:success true :data {:url "https://api.whatever.org/entries/1/" :title "Foo"} ...}

  (<! (rest/first-resource entries))
  ;; #cljs-rest.core.Resource{:success true :data {...}}

  ;; And so on...

  (<! (rest/head entries))
  (<! (rest/head entry-1))
  (<! (rest/update! entry-1 {:title "Bar" :body "Ipsum"}))
  (<! (rest/patch! entry-1 {:body "Consectetur"}))
  (<! (rest/delete! entry-1)))
```

### Ajax Options

Options are accepted from an `:opts` keword argument. Refer to [cljs-http](https://github.com/r0man/cljs-http) for options documentation.

Usage:

```clojure
(rest/resource-listing url :opts opts)
(rest/resource url :opts opts)
```

### Constructor

When provided, a `:constructor` keyword argument will be used to construct `Resource` data.

Usage:

```clojure
(defrecord Foo [])
(rest/resource-listing url :constructor map->Foo)
(rest/resource url :constructor map->Foo)
```

### Sequential async: `async->`

The `async->` macro, for conveniently performing sequential async calls, is similar to `clojure.core/->`, but the return value is a core async channel, and each step may return a channel as well.

Example usage:

```clojure
(async->
  some-listing
  rest/read
  :resources
  first
  (rest/update! {:foo "bar"}))
```

If any step in the async sequence returns an instance of `Error`, that will be the final value and subsequent steps will not  be called. Example:

```clojure
(defn response-error [listing]
  (if (:success listing)
      listing
      (ex-info "Request Error" listing)))

(async->
  some-listing
  rest/read
  response-error
  ;; If the request fails, the `ExceptionInfo` returned will be the final value,
  ;; and none of the following calls will be made:
  :resources
  first
  whatever)
```

### Releases

- 1.0.0 - Full rewrite, see the [migration guide](docs/migration_guide_1.0.0.md)
    - Each resource type now populates the following response data:
        - `success`
        - `status`
        - `headers`
        - `body`
    - Switched to [cljs-http](https://github.com/r0man/cljs-http), with some conveniences built around it:
        - `headers` includes both string keys (cljs-http default) as well as keywords
        - Convenience function to configure default format with `configure-format!`
    - Response errors are now pushed to a configurable channel, rather than a callback
    - Request formatting is extensible. EDN, Transit, JSON, FormData and Multipart are provided.
- 0.1.5 - `ResourceListing` provides a `first-item` convenience method
- 0.1.4
    - Fixed an issue where requests for `Resource` instances would drop `:url`
    - Fixed an issue where reading multiple times from a `ResourceListing` with a `:constructor` specified would corrupt results
- 0.1.3 - Any step in `async->` returning an instance of `Error` will short-circuit the chain
- 0.1.2 - Bugfix: when present, `:error-handler` in `cljs-rest.core/*opts*` will be called for error responses
- 0.1.1 - `FormData` payloads are automatically sent as `multipart/form-data`
- 0.1.0 - initial release
